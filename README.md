## Purpose
> Came across an acrticle that shows how to write Factorio mods using Typescript. Since it is a goal of mine this year to learn Typescript better, I thought this would be good practice.
* learning typescript
* how to write a mod
* new challenges to get the mind thinking of how code to benefit

## [Resource of inspiration](https://cdaringe.github.io/factorio-type-kit/posts/get-started)
* [factorio-type-kit](https://github.com/cdaringe/factorio-type-kit)
* [Typescript to Lua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/docs/getting-started/)
* [Factorio API - Lua](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/index.html)

### Goals

- [ ] replicate article mod: Vroom
- [ ] create mod that makes player run in specific pattern. perhaps some command then letter has player run in pattern of s automatically. Ths could allow user to lay bricks or patterns and spell things.
- [ ] create mod deflects damage given by enemy
